# SouthPark_generator
ENLP final project


South Park owns the most interesting dialogues among all cartoons. We all know that South Park is a cartoon with strong character personalities. By using the dialogue dataset, we will be able to build a generator that teaches the South Park characters to write poems in their own language or speaking style. At the end of the training session, they will all be able to write poems that reflect their mood and how they feel in their personal style.
